 S1) This is for install help. Only download this branch not the master.
 
 *NOTE: You need to copy the install.sh into /home/user from amd-fan-control-sec*
 
 S2) Aftrer downloading unzip the archive for sec branch and finally to run the install.sh script run:
    (Note: install.sh must be run in /home/user not /home/user/downloads!)
        chmod 0755 install.sh
        ./install.sh
 
 
 S3) You now should have a tool on your desktop - If the icon does not show up, feel free to just change the icon to one that is available.
